Relativity provides a DSL for programmatic layout that makes it easy to achieve pixel-perfect spacing and alignment.

## Programmatic Layout

There are four basic steps to laying out views programmatically.

1. **Create views**. Do this in `init` or `viewDidLoad`.
2. **Create view hierarchy** with `addSubview()`. Do this in `init` or `viewDidLoad`.
3. **Size views**. Do this in `layoutSubviews`.
4. **Position views**. Do this in `layoutSubviews`.

### Positioning Views

Each view has nine anchors that are used for alignment.

<table>
<tr><td>topLeft</td><td align="center">top</td><td align="right">topRight</td></tr>
<tr><td>left</td><td align="center">middle</td><td align="right">right</td></tr>
<tr><td>bottomLeft</td><td align="center">bottom</td><td align="right">bottomRight</td></tr>
</table>

Positioning views is done by aligning the desired anchor on a view to another view’s anchor, plus an offset. A `-->` moves the view on the left side to the position described on the right side. A `<--` moves the view on the right side to the position described on the left side. You can also explicitly align views using the `align(to:xOffset:yOffset)` method in [ViewPosition.swift](Sources/ViewPosition.swift#L105).

#### Examples

To align view `a` to be 10 points to the left of view `b`:

```swift
  a.right --> 10.horizontalOffset + b.left
```

To align view `a` to be 10 points to the right of view `b`:

```swift
  b.right + 10.horizontalOffset <-- a.left
```

To align view `a` to be 10 points below its superview’s top center:

```swift
  a.top --> 10.verticalOffset + .top
```

For more examples, check out the [ViewPositionVisualization](RelativityVisualization.playground/Pages/ViewPositionVisualization.xcplaygroundpage/Contents.swift) playground page.

#### UILabels

Relativity makes it easy to position your `UILabel`s using the font’s [cap height](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_height) and [baseline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_(typography)) by adding six anchors specifically for labels.

<table>
<tr><td>capLeft</td><td align="center">cap</td><td align="right">capRight</td></tr>
<tr><td>baselineLeft</td><td align="center">baseline</td><td align="right">baselineRight</td></tr>
</table>

If your spec says that the top of your `underlineView` should align with the baseline of label `a`, all you need is:

```swift
  underlineView.top --> a.baseline
```

For a visual example, check out the [FontMetricsVisualization](RelativityVisualization.playground/Pages/FontMetricsVisualization.xcplaygroundpage/Contents.swift) playground page.

### Flexible distribution of subviews

Since views need to be laid out flexibly over various iOS device sizes, Relativity has the ability to easily distribute subviews with flexible positioning along an axis.

Subview distribution can be controlled by positioning fixed and flexible spacers in between views. Fixed spaces represent points on screen. Fixed spaces are created by inserting `CGFloatConvertible` (`Int`, `Float`, `CGFloat`, or `Double`) types into the distribution expression, or by initializing a `.fixed(CGFloatConvertible)` enum case directly. Flexible spacers represent proportions of the remaining space in the superview after the subviews and fixed spacers have been accounted for. You can create flexible spacers by surrounding an `Int` with a spring `~` operator, or by initializing the `.flexible(Int)` enum case directly. A `~2~` represents twice the space that `~1~` does. Views, fixed spacers, and flexible spacers are bound together by a bidirectional anchor `<>` operator, or via a operatorless result builder.

#### Examples

To equally distribute subviews `a`, `b`, and `c` at equal distances along a horizontal axis:

```swift
  superview.distributeSubviewsHorizontally() {
    a <> ~1~ <> b <> ~1~ <> c
  }
```

To make the space between `a` and `b` twice as large as the space between `b` and `c`:

```swift
  superview.distributeSubviewsHorizontally() {
    a <> ~2~ <> b <> ~1~ <> c
  }
```

To pin `a` to be 8pts from the left side, and distribute `b` and `c` with equal spacing over the remaining space:

```swift
  superview.distributeSubviewsHorizontally() {
    8 <> a <> ~1~ <> b <> ~1~ <> c
  }
```

To equally distribute subviews `a`, `b`, and `c` at equal distances along a vertical axis, but align the subviews within the left half of `superview`:

```swift
  superview.distributeSubviewsVertically(within: CGRect(x: 0.0, y: 0.0, width: superview.bounds.midX, height: superview.bounds.height)) {
    a
    ~1~
    b
    ~1~
    c
  }
```

### Pixel Rounding

Relativity ensures that you never align a frame to a non-integral pixel, so no need to worry about blurry UI! I’ve also vended a public [PixelRounder](Sources/PixelRounder.swift) for those who want to use it for frame sizing.

### Sizing Views

Relativity makes it easy to size views based on the space between previously laid-out content. Use the `|--|` operator to determine the size between view anchors.

#### Examples

To size view `b` to fit between views `a` and `c`:

```swift
  b.bounds.size = a.topRight |--| c.bottomLeft
```

To size view `b` to fit between views `a` and `c` with a 16 point horizontal inset:

```swift
  b.bounds.size = a.topRight |--| c.bottomLeft + -16.horizontalOffset
```

To size view `b` to be the same height as view `a`, and fit between `a` and the right side of `a`'s superview:

```swift
  b.bounds.size = CGSize(width: (a.right |--| .right).width, height: a.bounds.height)
```

## Requirements

* Xcode 15.0 or later.
* iOS 13 or later.
* Swift 5.9 or later.

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

To install Relativity in your iOS project with [Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager), the following lines can be added to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/dfed/Relativity", from: "3.0.0"),
]
```

### CocoaPods

To install Relativity in your iOS project with [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), add the following to your `Podfile`:

```
platform :ios, '12.0'
pod 'Relativity', '~> 3.0'
```

### Submodules

To use git submodules, checkout the submodule with `git submodule add git@github.com:dfed/Relativity.git`, drag Relativity.xcodeproj to your project, and add Relativity as a build dependency.
